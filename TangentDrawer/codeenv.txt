 *
 * The following palceholders are defined:
 * ##E       The place where Code from an extension file is placed.
 * ##P		 The place where the auto-generated preamble is placed.
 * ##C[x|y]  The place where the auto-generated C#-expression of the
 *           input function is placed (for x- and y-components,
 *			 respectively).
 *
 * Please DO NOT change this until you know what you are doing.
